# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio – Christopher Jones

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository showcases practical, hands-on projects and assessments completed as part of my cybersecurity training at NSCC. Each item reflects core competencies in penetration testing, system hardening, malware analysis, threat emulation, physical security, and secure system architecture.

## 🧑‍💼 Resume
📄 [`Christopher.Jones.Resume.pdf`](./Resume/Christopher.Jones.Resume.pdf)  
A comprehensive overview of my technical experience, law enforcement background, and transition into cybersecurity.

---

## 🧬 Serious Malware
📄 [`Serious Malware.pdf`](./Serious-Malware/Serious%20Malware.pdf)  
Developed an advanced reverse shell malware using AES-encrypted payloads and in-memory execution. Built a fake OBS installer delivery system with persistence via Task Scheduler and WMI. Includes VirusTotal scan results and full source code.

---

## 💻 USB Drop Attack
📄 [`USB Drops.pdf`](./USB-Drop-Attack/USB%20Drops.pdf)  
Simulated a real-world USB drop attack using a disguised executable. The payload collected host data (network info, installed software, ports, etc.) invisibly and stored it locally for potential exfiltration. Demonstrated the dangers of rogue USBs.

---

## 🧟 Malware Execution
📄 [`Malware Execution.pdf`](./Malware-Execution/Malware%20Execution.pdf)  
Executed a malware sample in a safe lab environment using FLARE VM and Sysinternals tools. Analyzed its behavior through process trees, registry activity, and network traffic.

---

## 📎 Embedded Macros
📄 [`Embedded Macros.pdf`](./Embedded-Macros/Embedded%20Macros.pdf)  
Created a malicious VBA macro embedded in an Office document. The macro launched Outlook and sent an automated email without user interaction. Demonstrates risks of macro-enabled documents in phishing campaigns.

---

## 🪓 Living off the Land Binaries (LoLBins)
📄 [`LoLBins.pdf`](./LoLBins/LoLBins.pdf)  
Used trusted Windows binaries like `certutil` to bypass download restrictions and execute payloads. Simulated real-world attacker tactics and performed incident response on a suspected keylogger PCAP file.

---

## 🧠 Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign
📄 [`Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign.pdf`](./Awareness-Campaign/CYBERSECURITY%20AWARENESS%20CAMPAIGN.pdf)  
Designed and implemented a ransomware awareness training program. Included email rollout, stats and impact, 10-step prevention handout, simulated phishing, and post-training assessments.

---

## 🔒 LAMP Server Hardening
📄 [`LAMP-install-harden-script.pdf`](./LAMP-Hardening/LAMP-install-harden-script.pdf)  
Bash script to automate LAMP server installation and hardening: SSH configuration, UFW firewall, MySQL lockdown via `expect`, auto-updates, and logging. Designed for secure deployment on Ubuntu.

---

## 🌐 Network Investigation
📄 [`Network Investigation.pdf`](./Network-Investigation/Network%20Investigation.pdf)  
Analyzed suspicious traffic in a PCAP file using Wireshark. Detected abnormal communication, decoded Base64 payloads, and reconstructed the use of a keylogger and credential exfiltration.

---

## 🧱 CPTED Physical Security Assessment
📄 [`CPTED Physical Security Assessment.pdf`](./CPTED-Assessment/CPTED%20Physical%20Security%20Assessment.pdf)  
Conducted a site security assessment based on Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles. Assessed lighting, access control, natural surveillance, and territoriality.

---

## 🏗️ Secure 3-Tier Enterprise System
📄 [`Secure 3-Tier Enterprise System.pdf`](./3-Tier-System/Secure%203-Tier%20Enterprise%20System.pdf)  
Designed and documented a full-stack enterprise system for a fictional drone manufacturer, including web, application, and database tiers. Incorporated AES encryption, OAuth2, TLS 1.3, RBAC, SIEM, IDS, and compliance with NIST SP 800-53 and OWASP ASVS.

🎥 [`Presentation Slides`](./3-Tier-System/Secure%203-Tier%20Enterprise%20System%20Presentation.pptx)

---

## 🎤 Server Hardening Presentation
📄 [`Server Hardening Presentation.pptx`](./Presentations/Server%20Hardening%20Presentation.pptx)  
Group project walk-through of Windows Server 2016 hardening tasks. Covered RDP port changes, service audits, password policies, and hiding sensitive flag files from attackers.
